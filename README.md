# aeson-commit

[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/aeson-commit.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson-commit)

Aeson parsers backtracks too much for some use cases. The commit
parser forbids backtracking for already committed parses.

See [haddocks](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson-commit/docs/Data-Aeson-Commit.html) for more information and examples.
